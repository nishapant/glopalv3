    <h2>NADEAN GHOULEH</h2>
    <p class="left">Hey it's Nadean, I am currently a junior at Universal school. I honestly joined Girls Who Code to try something new and meet new people, which I did. The best part about the program was interacting with everyone. Some activities I enjoy are engaging in outdoor activities, spending time with family and friends, drawing, and reading. I appreciate everyone who encouraged me to get involved with Girls Who Code, it was truly a great experience. </p>
